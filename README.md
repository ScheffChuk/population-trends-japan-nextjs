## Notes

### 3/30 Recap
Finished scaffolding of the app. Implemented Tanstack Query and Zustand for stage management and got the data displayed. Question: Would there be security problems with server action that I used for queries. Get the app deployed.

### 3/31 Recap
Did not make much progress. Add reset checkbox feature. Thinking should I use app route for SSR? Maybe add Zod for schema validation? 

## 4/1 Recap
Have made a lot progress today. Added line chart feature. Successfully get the server side cache working. Built skeletons for card and checkbox. Made the app a little bit not ugly.
